## Inspiration
Following the launch of Team Seas, an organization that plan is to remove 30 million lbs. of trash from the ocean, we wanted a way to contribute to the cause. This got us thinking if there was a way to spread awareness about lesser-known issues around the world. Recognizing that contributions are strong in numbers, we strived for a lightweight solution to add to everyoneâ€™s day. More than 310 million people use the Chrome browser every day and, according to some studies, about 30% of those users utilize AdBlock. So why not create an AdBlock that supports worldwide issues, and spreads awareness.


## What it does
The chrome extension essentially allows the user to block all ads if they like or choose which ads they would like to see. Watching these ads contributes to the specific cause and a display of how much the user has donated is shown in the extension. The user is also able to donate money to causes that interest them via a payment form.
